## Whitechain

To ensure compatibility with existing technology and to leverage the
benefits of a popular community, Whitechain has chosen to remain
compatible with all existing smart contracts on Ethereum and Ethereum
tooling. This has been achieved by developing based on a go-ethereum
fork, as the team holds high respect for the excellent work of Ethereum:

Whitechain has rolled out a new EVM-compatible network utilizing
Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus to enable shorter block times
and reduced fees. As its development is based on go-ethereum fork,
you may observe that many toolings, binaries, and documentation are
based on Ethereum.

### PoA consensus

Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus is an efficient consensus algorithm
that was coined by Gavin Wood, a co-founder of the Ethereum
blockchain in 2017. In a PoA consensus, all nodes are
pre-authenticated, which allows using consensus types that provide a
high transaction rate in addition to other benefits.

#### Advantages of PoA consensus

Compared to other consensus types that require proof of spent
computational resources (Proof-of-Work) or an existing "share"
(Proof-of-Stake), PoA consensus has several notable advantages:

* It does not require high-performance hardware like PoW
consensus, which demands nodes to spend computational
resources for solving complex mathematical tasks
* The interval of time at which new blocks are generated is
predictable. For PoW and PoS consensuses, this time varies
* Blocks are generated in a sequence at appointed time intervals by
authorized network nodes, leading to a higher transaction rate
* PoA consensus is tolerant to compromised and malicious nodes,
as long as 51% of nodes are not compromised

#### How PoA consensus works in Whitechain

In Whitechain, only selected nodes known as validators (validating nodes) can
generate new blocks. These nodes are responsible for maintaining the
blockchain network and the distributed ledger. The blockchain registry
maintains the list of validators, and the order of nodes in this list
determines the sequence in which nodes generate new blocks.

### Quickstart with Docker

#### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Docker installed (get it from https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and a compatible operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

#### Start a full node
Open a terminal or command prompt, then enter:

```shell
docker run --rm -it \
  --name wbt -v /Users/alice/wbt:/root \
  -p 8545:8545 -p 30303:30303 \
  whitebit/wbt:v1.2.0 --wbt-mainnet
```

This will start `geth` in snap-sync mode with a DB memory allowance of 1GB just as the
above command does.  It will also create a persistent volume in your home directory for
saving your blockchain as well as map the default ports.

Do not forget `--http.addr 0.0.0.0`, if you want to access RPC from other containers
and/or hosts. By default, `geth` binds to the local interface and RPC endpoints are not
accessible from the outside.

#### Monitor logs
If you want to run Whitechain testnet node, you need to start `geth` with `--wbt-testnet` instead of `--wbt-mainnet`.

#### Monitor logs 
You can check if your node has started syncing by looking for the following log messages:
```text
INFO [08-04|12:00:00.000] Block synchronisation started 
INFO [08-04|12:00:00.001] Syncing: state download in progress      synced=6.25% state=302.12KiB accounts=1282@302.12KiB slots=0@0.00B codes=0@0.00B eta=17.148s
INFO [08-04|12:00:00.002] Syncing: chain download in progress      synced=0.01% chain=18.00B headers=1536@6.00B bodies=4@6.00B receipts=4@6.00B eta=1h49m39.978s
```

## Building the source

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the geth [Installation Instructions](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/install-and-build/installing-geth).

Building `geth` requires both a Go (version 1.18 or later) and a C compiler. You can install
them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

```shell
make geth
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```shell
make all
```

## Executables

The Whitechain project comes with several wrappers/executables found in the `cmd`
directory.

|   Command   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Running `geth`

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here (please consult our
[CLI Wiki page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/command-line-options)),
but we've enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly
on how you can run your own `geth` instance.

### Hardware Requirements
Minimum:

CPU with 2+ cores
8GB RAM
100GB free storage space to sync the blockchain
8 MBit/sec download Internet service

Recommended:
Fast CPU with 4+ cores
16GB+ RAM
High-performance SSD with at least 500GB of free space
25+ MBit/sec download Internet service

### Configuration

As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `geth` binary, you can also pass a
configuration file via:

```shell
$ geth --wbt-mainnet --config /path/to/your_config.toml
```

To get an idea how the file should look like you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to
export your existing configuration:

```shell
$ geth --wbt-mainnet --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig
```

### Programmatically interfacing `geth` nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you'll want to start interacting with `geth` and the
Ethereum network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid
this, `geth` has built-in support for a JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/api-documentation/)
and [`geth` specific APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/server)).
These can be exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (UNIX sockets on UNIX based
platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by `geth`,
whereas the HTTP and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a
subset of APIs due to security reasons. These can be turned on/off and configured as
you'd expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

  * `--http` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
  * `--http.addr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--http.port` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: `8545`)
  * `--http.api` API's offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--http.corsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
  * `--ws.addr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--ws.port` WS-RPC server listening port (default: `8546`)
  * `--ws.api` API's offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--ws.origins` Origins from which to accept websockets requests
  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
  * `--ipcapi` API's offered over the IPC-RPC interface (default: `admin,debug,eth,miner,net,personal,txpool,web3`)
  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You'll need to use your own programming environments' capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to
connect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `geth` node configured with the above flags and you'll
need to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) on all transports. You
can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based
transport before doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert
Ethereum nodes with exposed APIs! Further, all browser tabs can access locally
running web servers, so malicious web pages could try to subvert locally available
APIs!**
